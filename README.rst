*Jam.py is really GREAT! Simple, powerful, beautiful.
It's what I was looking for, for years.

I love the way it works, the browser administration and the code editor.
This project deserves to become long-living open, a big community and a lot of fame !
Please, please, tell me that you gonna do everything so that it will be broadly adopted.

Main features
=============

Jam.py is an object oriented, event driven framework with hierarchical structure, modular design
and very tight DB/GUI coupling. The server side of Jam.py is written in `Python <https://www.python.org">`_,
the client utilizes `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript">`_,
`jQuery <https://jquery.com">`_ and `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2">`_.

* Simple, clear and efficient IDE. The development takes place in the 
  Application builder, an application written completely in Jam.py.
  
* “All in the browser” framework. With Jam.py, all you need are two pages 
  in the browser, one for the project, the other for the Application builder. 
  Make changes in the Application builder, go to the project, refresh the page, 
  and see the results.  
  
* Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, MSSQL and 
  Oracle databases. The concept of the framework allows you to migrate from 
  one database to another without changing the project.
  
* Authentication, authorization, session management, roles and permissions.

* Automatic creation and modification of database tables and SQL queries generation.

* Data-aware controls.

* Open framework. You can use any Javascript/Python libraries.

* Rich, informative reports. Band-oriented report generation based on 
  `LibreOffice <https://www.libreoffice.org/">`_ templates.

* Charts. You can use free `jsCharts <http://www.jscharts.com/>`_ library
  or any javascript charting library to create charts to represent and analyze your application data.
  
* Allows to save audit trail/change history made by users

* Predifined css themes.

* Develop and test locally update remotely. Jam.py has Export and Import 
  utilities that allow developer to store all metadata (database structures,
  project parameters and code) in a file that can be loaded by another 
  application to apply all the changes.
